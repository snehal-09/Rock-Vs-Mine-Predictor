# Rock-Vs-Mine-Predictor
📌 **Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification Project**
I built a 🧠 **machine learning classification model** using the 🎯 **Sonar Dataset** from UCI.
The goal is to predict whether the object is a **rock (🪨)** or a **mine (💣)** based on sonar signal features.
⚙️ This project helped me practice data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for binary classification tasks.
